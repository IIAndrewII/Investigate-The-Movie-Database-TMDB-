# (TMDB): Movie Database Analysis
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDB), including user ratings and revenue.

Throughout this project, I will go through a series of data cleansing, data Transformation and data analysis to answer the following questions:


- Who is the actor with most movies?

- Who is the director with most movies?

- Who is the actor that makes the most money?

- Who is the director that makes the most money?

- Which genres are most popular from year to year?
